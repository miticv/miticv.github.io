#Webpack
Alternative to using gulp or grunt

## Why Build Client side apps
* Multiple web request (combine fles)
* Code size (minify files)
* Order dependencies (use module system)
* Transpilations (compatibility to use Ecma Script 6 in browser that do not support it)
* Linting


## Other tools to around builds
* Server side tools
* Grunt or Gulp (task runners)
ES6 => js => min.js => combined
scss => css => min.css => combined
## Webpack
do everything tak runners do
plus can combine js and css together also

* Webpack uses NPM not bower
* Webpack uses all 3 module systems (AMD, CommonJs and EcmaScript) 

## CLI basics

(node has to be installed)
```
npm install webpack -g
```
